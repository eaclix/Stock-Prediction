# LSTM-Based Stock Trend Prediction: Forecasting Market Movements with Deep Learning

Harness the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock market trends and forecast future prices. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in financial time series analysis, offering insights into potential market movements.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Advanced Time Series Analysis**: Utilize LSTM networks to capture complex temporal dependencies in stock price data.
- **Comprehensive Data Pipeline**: From data collection to preprocessing, our robust pipeline ensures high-quality input for the model.
- **Customizable Model Architecture**: Easily adjust the LSTM layers and hyperparameters to optimize performance.
- **Performance Visualization**: Generate insightful plots comparing predicted vs. actual stock prices.
- **Quantitative Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy using industry-standard metrics like MSE, RMSE, and MAE.

## 📊 Project Overview

1. **Data Acquisition**: Fetch historical stock data (default: AMZN) using `yfinance`, ensuring up-to-date and reliable financial information.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculate technical indicators like Moving Averages (MA) to enrich the dataset.
3. **Data Normalization**: Apply MinMax scaling to standardize input features, crucial for neural network training.
4. **Sequence Generation**: Create time-stepped sequences of stock prices, mimicking the temporal nature of financial markets.
5. **LSTM Model Construction**: Design a deep LSTM architecture with dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
6. **Training and Validation**: Implement a train-test split to ensure model generalization and prevent look-ahead bias.
7. **Future Price Prediction**: Utilize the trained model to forecast upcoming stock price movements.
8. **Performance Analysis**: Evaluate the model's predictive power using statistical measures and visual comparisons.
